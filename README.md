# subLSTM

This is a PyTorch implementation of subLSTMs as described in the article Corical Microcircuits as Gated Recurrent Units ([Costa et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02448)).

Currently only the basic Python code using PyTorch is implemented. Will add a C++ backend later.

A lot of code was recycled from [pytorch](http://pytorch.org) and [ixaxaar](https://github.com/ixaxaar/pytorch-sublstm)'s implementation.
